# Machine-Learning-Job-Interview-Questions
Containing questions that can be asked in a ML interview.

1) A company says they are scoring test data in the database not in RAM, which means no pickle file is used to score new data. Which ML algorithm is most likely used by that company?

2) Let's say we have 2 datasets. Both have binary targets. Target ratio of first dataset is 1:99. Target ratio of second dataset is 10:90. For both, we have 0.80 AUC. On which dataset we are more successfull?

3) Which ML algorithm may contain more than one target column during training? Describe briefly.

4) What is the difference between Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees?

5) Which machine learning algorithm works best with categorical features which have high cardinality?

6) How do you feed categorical variables into Neural Networks for tabular data?

7) How do you handle null values if you want to train a NN?
